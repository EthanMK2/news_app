An app that uses CSS modules, React, and the Bing News Search RESTful API. This app features a news search page that displays articles according to a search query or category selection. It also enables email authentication, allowing users to track their previous article browsing history, in case they want to revisit any of them. This backend capability is implemented using Firebase's authentication API and non-relational database to store users and their data. I used many fundamental React features such as Hooks, Context API, React Router, Components, and good file structure. 

The hardest part for me was the Bing News Search API, where I had to adapt the project to accommodate for the various data structures and queries. One thing I definitely learned in this project was how important it is to make sustainable, maintainable code as the project increases in complexity.
